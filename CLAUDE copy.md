### PR creation guide
- go to the frontend or backend folder where you wanted to change the code
- first check the branch should be main
- if the branch is not main than you can switch to main branch
- if there are the local changes than you can stash them
- then after switching to branch checkout to a new branch with the Customer support ticket number 
- if the customer support ticket number branch is already created then add version in the branch name
- do the code changes
- commit only necessary changes
- then create the pr against the main branch using gh pr create
- after completion of the work again checkout ot main branch
